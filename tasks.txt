I merged in the home collection at ./home/. Merge it into the mkdesk collection at ./ and refactor the collection so we have one role for every functionality we are configuring. The grouping should come mostly from the files in home/roles/home/tasks/. Each role should be split into two task files called by the main.yaml, a home.yaml and a system.yaml. The system.yaml installs the necessary system packages and configures system wide configuration. The home.yaml configures the current users home directory with functions the user needs to use the apps. In the main.yaml there is a condition to see which mkdesk_mode is activated, home, system or both.
The default home configuration for tmux should be that Ctrl-a gives access to the shortcuts, like in screen. 
Create a micro role that installs and configures the micro editor. I want autosave and softwrap enabled per default in my home directory.
Create a zed role that configures and installs the zed editor (only home mode with local installation). Use the settings file from my home directory as a template.
